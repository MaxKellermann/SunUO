What is SunUO?
--------------

SunUO is a free Ultima Online server, based on RunUO.


Getting SunUO
-------------

You can download SunUO on the home page:

 http://max.kellermann.name/projects/sunuo/


Installing SunUO
----------------

Download and install the binary RunUO package, version 1.0.0:

 http://www.runuo.com/downloads/files/runuo-releases/RunUO-1.0.0.zip

Unzip it somewhere, and copy the file SunUO.exe into the same
directory. Now run:

 mono SunUO.exe

SunUO and RunUO are binary compatible, the configuration is the same.


Features
--------

SunUO has the following new features compared to RunUO:

** Portability **

SunUO runs with Mono, e.g. on Linux. RunUO has a lot of bugs which
prevent this.

** New directory structure **

SunUO tries to manage its files better; this development is far from
finished, and mimics the FHS:

 ./etc          configuration files, managed by the administrator
 ./local        local (customized?) data for this shard, e.g. scripts
 ./var          files which are managed and modified by SunUO
 ./var/log      log files
 ./var/cache    cache, e.g. precompiled script libraries
 ./var/backup   world saves


** Multiple script libraries **

Every directory below ./local/src/ may contain a separate script
library; additionally, DLL files from ./local/lib/ are loaded. This
splits up the base RunUO scripts from your own custom scripts.

This has a big advantage if you are developing scripts: SunUO
recompiles only the script library you selected. SunUO starts up much
faster than RunUO for this reason.

Example:
 RunUO base scripts: ./Scripts/
 custom library 1: ./local/src/foo/
 custom library 2: ./local/src/bar/
 custom library 3: ./local/lib/test.dll

The compiled .DLL files are written to ./var/cache/lib/ - SunUO will
not recompile if it finds a compiled .DLL file. If you want SunUO to
recompile the "bar" library, shut down SunUO and execute:

 rm -r ./var/lib/foo

SunUO recreates the files on the next startup.


** Single configuration file **

In RunUO, much of the configuration is done by editing the ./Scripts/
source codes. That makes upgrading a nightmare. SunUO tries to put as
much as possible into the file ./etc/sunuo.xml, although this is
limited currently, because compatibility with RunUO is important.


Advanced
--------

** Excluding source codes and classes **

If you want to disable some items or source codes, you can use the
following configuration in ./etc/sunuo.xml:

 <libraries>
   <library name="foo">
     <ignore-type name="Bar.cs"/>
     <ignore-type name="Blubb"/>
   </library>
 </libraries>

This tells SunUO not to compile the file "Bar.cs", and to ignore the
type "Blubb". You can use this to disable commands or to disable items
in the game.


** Separate login server from shard server **

To make SunUO ignore the AuthID, configure:

 <login>
   <ignore-auth-id/>
 </login>

This allows you to run the login server and the shard server on
different machines. This is safe, because both check the password
independently. It is however important that the account databases on
both servers are the same.


Porting a shard to SunUO
------------------------

You can seamlessly port your shard from RunUO to SunUO and back, they
are compatible. Just execute SunUO.exe instead of RunUO.exe.

There are a few minor changes regarding script compilation and
backups, which are meant to be improvements; please read the
"Features" section thoroughly, to find out more about this.
