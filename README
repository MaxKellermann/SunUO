What is SunUO?
--------------

SunUO is a free Ultima Online server, based on RunUO.


Getting SunUO
-------------

You can download SunUO on the home page:

 http://max.kellermann.name/projects/sunuo/


Installing SunUO
----------------

Download and install the binary RunUO package, version 1.0.0:

 http://www.runuo.com/downloads/files/runuo-releases/RunUO-1.0.0.zip

Unzip it somewhere, and copy the file SunUO.exe into the same
directory. Now run:

 mono SunUO.exe

SunUO and RunUO are binary compatible, the configuration is the same.


Features
--------

SunUO has the following new features compared to RunUO:

** Portability **

SunUO runs with Mono, e.g. on Linux. RunUO has a lot of bugs which
prevent this.

** Multiple script libraries **

Every directory below ./local/src/ may contain a separate script
library. This splits up the base RunUO scripts from your own custom
scripts.

This has a big advantage if you are developing scripts: SunUO
recompiles only the script library you selected. SunUO starts up much
faster than RunUO for this reason.

Example:
 RunUO base scripts: ./Scripts/
 custom library 1: ./local/src/foo/
 custom library 2: ./local/src/bar/

The compiled .DLL files are written to ./var/cache/lib/ - SunUO will
not recompile if it finds a compiled .DLL file. If you want SunUO to
recompile the "bar" library, shut down SunUO and execute:

 rm -r ./var/lib/foo

SunUO recreates the files on the next startup.
