sunuo (0.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * imported RunUO 1.0.0 sources, fork is called SunUO 0.1.0
  * wrote Makefile
  * some minor mono-mcs compilation fixes
  * replaced the overcomplex mono-compatibility unsafe code in
    TileMatrix.cs and TileMatrixPatch.cs by a simple Marshal.Copy
  * repaired pointer arithmetic in Serialization.cs and TileMatrix.cs
  * pass script file names in a temporary files, to go around the
    "argument too long" limitation on most POSIX systems
  * moved the World.Load() call from ScriptCompiler to Main
  * ScriptCompiler.m_Assemblies converted to ArrayList
  * removed method TileMatrix.Force(), which was good for nothing
  * added Core.BaseDirectoryInfo, Core.CacheDirectoryInfo,
    Core.LocalDirectoryInfo
  * support for multiple script directories in ./local/src/, every one of
    them is built into a separate DLL
  * log to ./var/log/console.log instead of ./Logs/Console.log
  * implemented a lot of exception handlers in Network/PacketHandlers.cs,
    to prevent the server from crashing on a
  * catch exceptions from Core.VerifySerialization(); dump
    LoaderExceptions
